This project is the back end for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
- This project uses functional Express.js APIs.

- When a user enters schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- When a user enters the command to invoke the application, then a server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
